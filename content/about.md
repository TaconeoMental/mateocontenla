My name is Mateo Contenla and I live in Santiago, Chile. My greatest passion is
to learn as much stuff as I can with the resources that I've got. In the past,
I've taught myself how to program in a myriad of languages, have studied about
electronics, hypnosis, micro expressions, mentalism, water rocketry, and more.
Recently I've got into CTF events to test my knowledge about software and
computers. I'll be posting all of my solves in here!

I think there's a lot more to say about me, but I hope this blog speaks for
itself and for all the things I may have omitted here.
