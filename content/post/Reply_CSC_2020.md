A few days ago on _09/10/2020_ Reply held yet another Cyber Security challenge on their site. It was a jeopardy style CTF with 25 flags spread across 5 different categories and 24 hours to find them.

The prizes for the competition looked great so my team and I registered immediately hoping for the best. We had seen past challenges that they'd organized and our hopes were really high.

Anyway, this is my write-up for the challenges I managed to complete during the competition. It wasn't as easy as I expected, but I'm satisfied with what I accomplished. Lets go by category:

## Coding
...
## Web
...
## Binary
...
## Crypto
...
## Miscellaneous
...

So that's it! I hope you take something useful from this write-up.
Overall it was a really fun experience and I personally learned a lot of new stuff, and that alone is more than enough for me. Kudos to the reply team for putting up such a great competition"
