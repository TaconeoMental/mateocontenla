      <description>A few days ago on 09/10/2020 Reply held yet another Cyber Security challenge on their site. It was a jeopardy style CTF with 25 flags spread across 5 different categories and 24 hours to find them.
The prizes for the competition looked great so my team and I registered immediately hoping for the best. We had seen past challenges that they&amp;rsquo;d organized and our hopes were really high.
Anyway, this is my write-up for the challenges I managed to complete during the competition.</description>
